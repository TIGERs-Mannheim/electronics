# TIGERs Mannheim Open-Source Electronics

This repository contains electronics for our robots and our base station. There is one folder for each released version. The following files are present for each release.

### EAGLE
Electronics are designed with [Autodesk EAGLE](https://www.autodesk.com/education/free-software/eagle) which is available for free for students.
This folder contains all schematics (.sch) and board (.brd) files.

### PDF
All schematics are also available as PDF files. This makes it easier to view them without a need to install EAGLE.

### CAM
CAM jobs for EAGLE. Used to produce manufacturing data from board files.

### Gerber
Production ready zip packages for all boards. Most PCB production services directly accept gerber files.
